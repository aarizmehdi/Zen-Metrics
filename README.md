## Overview

**Zen Metrics** is a high-performance, real-time system telemetry dashboard engineered for precision monitoring and advanced data visualization. Built with a focus on "void black" aesthetics and sub-millisecond rendering performance, this system provides a futuristic interface for tracking complex node metrics, network throughput, and system health.

This project represents the pinnacle of modern web engineering, utilizing hardware-accelerated graphics and a custom-built responsiveness engine to ensure flawless operation across all devices—from 8K desktop workstations to mobile viewports.

## 🚀 Key Features

-   **Real-Time Telemetry**: Websocket-driven data stream with <10ms latency updates.
-   **Advanced Visualization**: Custom SVG and Canvas-based charting engines for high-frequency data.
-   **"Void Black" Aesthetic**: A meticulously crafted dark mode UI designed to reduce eye strain and maximize data contrast.
-   **Universal Responsiveness**: Fully adaptive layout that scales perfectly to mobile, tablet, and ultra-wide desktop monitors.
-   **Hardware Acceleration**: Utilizes Framer Motion's GPU-backed animation driver for 60fps+ transitions.
-   **Secure Architecture**: Enterprise-grade data isolation and secure API endpoints.
